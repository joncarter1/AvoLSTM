# AvoLSTM
Time series prediction on the Kaggle Avocado dataset using an LSTM.

Uses interal neural network package "ReTorch" which re-implements some of the internals from PyTorch:
- Adam and SGD optimisers, including hyper-gradient variants
- Fully-connected, Conv1D and MaxPool1D neural network layers

Work done as part of the AIMS CDT course.
